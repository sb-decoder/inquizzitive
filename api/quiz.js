      Generate ${numQuestions} multiple-choice questions focused on ${selectedCategory}, tailored for Indian government exam preparation (e.g., UPSC, SSC, or similar competitive exams). Ensure questions are exam-oriented: they should cover key topics, historical events, policies, figures, or concepts relevant to the category, with a focus on factual accuracy, analytical depth, and real-world application where appropriate.

      Adhere to the selected difficulty level which is ${selectedDifficulty}:
      - Easy: Basic recall of facts, straightforward questions with obvious distractors.
      - Medium: Require moderate understanding, including connections between concepts, with plausible distractors.
      - Hard: In-depth analysis, nuanced details, or application-based questions, with closely related distractors that test deep knowledge.

      Guidelines for high-quality questions:
      - Make questions clear, concise, and unambiguousâ€”avoid vagueness, overly broad topics, or irrelevant trivia.
      - Ensure relevance: For Current Affairs, use events up to October 2025; for History/Geography/Politics/Indian Defence, focus on India-centric or globally significant topics impacting India.
      - Options: Provide exactly 4 options per question. Distractors must be plausible and based on common misconceptions or related facts.
      - Answer: Must be factually correct and exactly match one option (case-sensitive, including spacing).
      - Explanation: Provide a detailed, educational explanation (2-4 sentences) citing why the answer is correct and why others are not, to aid learning.

      Respond strictly in valid JSON array format (no extra text, code blocks, or markdown). Example:
      [
        {
          "question": "Who is the current Prime Minister of India?",
          "options": ["Narendra Modi", "Rahul Gandhi", "Amit Shah", "Yogi Adityanath"],
          "answer": "Narendra Modi",
          "explanation": "Narendra Modi has been the Prime Minister of India since 2014, leading the BJP government. The other options are prominent politicians but not the current PM."
        }
      ]

      Ensure the entire response is parseable as JSON.`;
